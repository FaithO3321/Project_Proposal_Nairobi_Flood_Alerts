# Early Warning System for Heavy Rains and Floods in Nairobi

## Project Overview

### Name and Tagline
**Name:** Early Warning System for Heavy Rains and Floods in Nairobi

**Tagline:** The vulnerability of Nairobi to climate change is increasing at a high rate. There is a necessity to inform people about the changing patterns. The goal of this project is to make a complete and easy-to-use web platform that serves as an early warning system for floods, utilizing real-time data and cutting-edge technologies. The site will integrate relevant APIs and data sources to monitor weather conditions, precipitation levels, river levels, and different factors contributing to flood risks. Through interactive maps, visualizations, and personalized alerts, the platform aims to provide timely and location-specific warnings to users, enabling them to take precautions and mitigate potential damages caused by floods. Additionally, the site will offer educational resources on flood preparedness, safety measures, and the effects of climate change on flood events, promoting awareness and fostering proactive measures within communities.

### Objectives
- Thorough flood early warning system: The primary focus is on developing a dedicated platform for monitoring and providing early alerts associated with flood events.
- Continuous data integration: Utilizing APIs and data sources to access state-of-the-art data on atmospheric conditions, precipitation levels, stream levels, and other relevant factors that contribute to flood risks.
- Interactive maps and visualizations: Using interactive maps, charts, and visualizations to present data in a user-friendly and visually appealing manner, enabling users to comprehend the dangers posed by flooding in their regions.
- Customized alerts: Providing users with the ability to receive personalized alerts and notifications based on their location or preferences, ensuring timely warnings and enabling proactive measures.
- Educational resources: Offering educational content on flood preparedness, safety measures, and the effects of climate change on flood events, promoting awareness and knowledge within communities.
- Engaging users: Providing users with the necessary information and tools to take precautions and mitigate potential damages caused by floods, ultimately improving community resilience.
- Proactive measures: Enabling proactive measures by raising awareness and fostering a culture of preparedness within communities vulnerable to flood risks.

## Team

### Names
- Emma Ogutu (Cohort 19)
- Faith Akinyi (Cohort 19)

### Roles
The partners will both work on every step of the project, handling the front-end and back-end together.

#### Front-end Responsibilities
- User Interface Design: Creating an intuitive and responsive UI for displaying interactive maps, data visualizations, alerts, and educational content.
- Data Visualization: Implementing interactive charts, graphs, and maps to visualize real-time data on weather patterns, precipitation levels, river levels, and flood risks.
- User Interaction: Handling user interactions, such as location selection, personalization preferences, and alert subscriptions.
- Personalized Alerts: Integrating mechanisms to display personalized alerts and notifications based on user locations or preferences.
- Educational Content: Presenting educational resources, safety measures, and preparedness information in an accessible and engaging format.
- Responsive Design: Ensuring the website is optimized for various devices and screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

#### Back-end Responsibilities
- API Integrations: Integrating with relevant APIs such as OpenWeatherMap and a flood alerts API.
- Data Processing: Cleaning, transforming, and processing the data received from APIs to ensure consistency and usability.
- Geospatial Data Handling: Managing and processing geospatial data related to flood risk areas, river networks, and user locations.
- Alert Generation: Implementing logic and algorithms to generate personalized alerts and notifications based on user locations and preferences.
- Data Storage: Storing and managing historical data, user preferences, and other relevant information using MySQL Alchemy database.
- User Authentication: Handling user authentication and authorization if the website requires user accounts or personalized features.
- Server-side Rendering: Generating dynamic content and rendering server-side components for improved performance and SEO optimization.

### Decision for Roles
Working together will be easy due to 100% accessibility of both partners. It will also help the partners become full-stack engineers by understanding both front-end and back-end applications.

## Technologies

### Front-end
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Back-end
- Python (Server-side language)
- Flask (Web framework)
- MySQL Alchemy (Database)

### APIs and Data Sources
- OpenWeatherMap API (Weather data)
- Flood Alerts API (Flood data)

## Trade-offs and Decisions

### Back-end Language and Framework
- **Chosen Technology:** Python with Flask
- **Alternative:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Trade-offs and Decision:** Python with Flask was chosen based on preference and the strong data processing and scientific computing capabilities of Python, which can be beneficial for handling and analyzing the various data sources related to flood early warning systems. Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework that allows for rapid development and easy integration with Python's rich ecosystem of libraries. Node.js with Express.js is a great alternative, especially for its event-driven architecture and performance benefits for real-time applications, but Python was preferred in this case.

The technology choices align with our preferences and provide a solid foundation for developing the early warning system website for floods. Python's strength in data processing and analysis, combined with Flask's simplicity and flexibility, make it a suitable choice for the back-end, while the front-end leverages the power of JavaScript and its extensive ecosystem of libraries for building interactive visualizations and user interfaces.

## Challenge

### Problem the Portfolio Project is intended to solve
The early warning system website for floods is specifically designed to address the critical need for timely and accurate flood-related information dissemination to communities and individuals in Nairobi regions vulnerable to flood risks. By providing real-time data monitoring, interactive visualizations, and personalized alerts tailored to the Nairobi context, the project aims to enhance preparedness, enable proactive measures, and ultimately mitigate the potential damages and losses caused by flood events in Nairobi.

### What the Portfolio Project will not solve
While the project will provide a comprehensive platform for flood early warning systems in Nairobi, it is important to understand its limitations. The website will not directly prevent or control flood occurrences, as these natural disasters are influenced by various environmental factors and climate change dynamics specific to Nairobi. Additionally, the project will not replace the need for robust infrastructure, emergency response systems, or government-led disaster management efforts within Nairobi.
